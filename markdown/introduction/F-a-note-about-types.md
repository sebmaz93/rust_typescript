## One more thing about rust

You will hear me say the following words

<br />

- value
- mutable reference or mutable borrow
- immutable reference or immutable borrow

<br />

This isn't something that as a JS dev you think about.

<br />

So what is a reference (probably heard the term)?
What is a mutable reference? (probably never heard this)?
(whiteboard)

## () is a unit

`()` is called "unit." Effectively it is "nothing" value.

```rust
if true {
    println!("foo");
}


// I could write this
// --v this has type ()
let foo = if true {
    println!("foo");
}
```
