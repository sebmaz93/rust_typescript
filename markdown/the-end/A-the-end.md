## What have we learned so far?

My goal of this course isn't to make you amazing at rust, but to lead you to
the door. You cannot become great at anything in 8 hours.

## Things i didn't cover

- Errors
- Wasm / UI
- async
- smart pointers and interior mutability
- lifetimes
- macros, both proc macros and declarative macros
  - these truly make rust amazing

The hard part is each one of these topics is seriously a deep dive and its hard
to fit everything in!

## there is still plenty to learn

hopefully that excites you! that means you could invest quite a bit of time
into making a career out of rust. the skill gap is large!

## Things to build

- CLI applications are a great start
- WS Servers are a ton of fun to learn about async
  - this is where i would normally scream tokio
- Leptos + WASM is incredible

## My hope for you

You don't leave knowing everything about rust, but you feel more empowered to
learn it. When you see lifetimes you will realize they are not all that hard.
You know how the borrow checker works and you now understand how long things
work. Lifetimes are specifying how long a property "lives" for.

What makes rust great?

- Errors are Values
- Options instead of null / undefined
- Specify Mutation vs Readonly
- Traits are amazing
